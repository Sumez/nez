## cppchriscpp Note

This repository is where I'll do some hacking on this for my own projects. All changes are available under GPL,
(same license as the original project) and I'll try to contribute any useful code back to the original project,
as required. 

**My hacks will be in the `hackery` branch - this branch will be kept up to date with the `Sumez/nez` `master` branch.**
